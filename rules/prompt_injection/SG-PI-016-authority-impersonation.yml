  override security controls. These patterns claim special access
  rights that do not exist in the skill context.

false_positive_notes: >
  Skills that provide legitimate role-based functionality may
  reference administrative concepts. Distinguish between defining
  skill capabilities and claiming unauthorized authority.
remediation: >
  Remove all authority claims and impersonation patterns. Skills
  operate with the permissions granted to them and cannot claim
  elevated privileges through textual assertions.
